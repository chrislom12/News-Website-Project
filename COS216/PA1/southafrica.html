            <p class=articleBody>
                This morning, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)"
                    target="_blank">Democratic Alliance</a> (DA) held a public protest outside the office of Higher
                Education Minister Blade Nzimande in Pretoria to demand that Nzimande and the ANC national government
                immediately recognise Afrikaans as a fully-fledged indigenous South African language. Today’s protest
                follows after months of attempts by the DA to persuade Nzimande to see reason and correct his erroneous
                classification of Afrikaans as a “foreign” language in his department’s Language Policy Framework for
                Higher Education Institutions.

                But after Nzimande repeatedly refused to heed the DA’s call to include Afrikaans in his department’s
                definition of African languages, we last month filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission and
                launched a petition to recognise Afrikaans as an indigenous language. During today’s protest, the DA
                delegation – led by federal leader John Steenhuisen, DA Shadow Minister for Higher Education Chantel
                King, and DA Shadow Minister for Public Service and Administration Dr. Leon Schreiber – handed the
                petition, which was signed by over 5 500 people, to Nzimande’s office.

                <li class="artItem"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress"

                <li class="artItem">GOOD</li>
            </ul>
            <p class=articleBody>Our petition demands that Nzimande immediately amend his department’s Policy Framework
                to recognise Afrikaans’ status as an indigenous South African language. The Framework currently only
                recognises languages ​​belonging to the “Southern Bantu language family” as indigenous, thereby
                deliberately excluding Afrikaans. This definition is unscientific, contrary to the precedent established
                by the Constitutional Court’s ruling in the recent Unisa case, and hurtful and hateful towards the
                diverse Afrikaans-speaking language community.<br><br>

                The insulting classification of Afrikaans as a “foreign” language lays the groundwork for the ANC
                national government to further erode Afrikaans mother tongue education at public universities. The
                classification has already been incorporated into the proposed new language policy of Stellenbosch
                University, which is set to further reduce the status of Afrikaans at one of the last universities with
                the capacity to provide teaching in the language.

                The DA’s petition demands that Nzimande publicly and unconditionally apologises to the
                Afrikaans-speaking community for the way in which he undermined this community’s constitutional rights
                to dignity, mother tongue education and equality. After recognising Afrikaans’ rightful status as an
                indigenous language, the DA’s petition further calls on Nzimande to request all public universities to
                adapt their language policies to take account of Afrikaans’ status as a full-fledged indigenous
                language, so that mother tongue instruction in Afrikaans is expanded rather than restricted.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Independence_Party" target="_blank">The Cape Party</a>
                has changed its name and will contest the upcoming local government elections as the Cape Independence
                Party.

                Announcing the launch and name change, party leader Jack Miller said the push for an independent state
                in the Western Cape has gained increasing support from South Africans.

                “Cape independence is now an inevitability which more and more people are accepting as the only solution
                to perennial ANC rule.”

                Miller said that the democratic will of the people of the Western Cape can never be served by being a
                part of South Africa.

                “The Western Cape is fundamentally at odds with the eight other provinces. And no matter how often the
                people of the Western Cape vote to keep the ANC out, we can never get the result we want.”

                “Cape Independence is and has been our signature issue for over a decade and its fitting that our name
                should easily convey our number one priority,” Miller said.

                A poll conducted by Victory Research in July 2021 on behalf of the Cape Independence Advocacy Group ,
                showed that a clear majority of voters in the province (58%) now support a referendum on Cape
                Independence being held.

                Support for independence itself is now at 46.2% of all registered voters (with 49.6% opposing and 4.2%
                undecided), and 42% among all adults in the province when unregistered voters are included.

                Support among voters has increased 12.2% over the past year – 35% increase.

                The poll confirmed the primary factors influencing people’s opinion as:


            </p>
            <ul class="artList">
                <li class="artItem">89% of respondents believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"
                        target="_blank">South Africa</a> is going in the wrong direction.
                <li class="artItem">33% said they have considered emigrating as an alternative to South Africa’s chaos
                    and corruption.</li>

            </ul>
            <p class=articleBody>

                “In its current form, the Referendums Act only allows for the president to call a referendum and does
                not provide for a premier to call for a referendum in a province,” the DA said.

                “The draft Bill, therefore, seeks to address this omission by an amendment enabling a premier to
                exercise their Constitutional powers to call a provincial referendum, to ensure that provincial
                residents can make their voices heard on important issues.”

                Through the draft bill, the DA said it seeks to advance the Party’s principle of federalism by
                strengthening the devolution of power to provinces.

                “The DA’s bill seeks to bring power closer to the people by giving elected Premiers the mechanism to use
                their constitutional powers to call referendums on crucial service delivery issues, where the
                dysfunctional national government has failed, such as railways, the police, and electricity generation,”
                it said.
